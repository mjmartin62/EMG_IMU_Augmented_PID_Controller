# EMG_IMU_Augmented_PID_Controller
Study the ability to use EMG signals to improve the response time of a PID controller for robotic arm movement

### Video Demos:  
TBD

### Introduction:
This project analyzes the ability to reduce the latency of a single robotic articulator using sensor fusion under the context of a digital closed loop controller.

### Project Highlights and Learning Goals:
 - Low level usage of FreeRTOS
 - Realtime algorithm and implementation tracing using patched instrumentation

### Key findings (To Date):
 - TBD
 - TBD


### Hardware Requirements and System Design:
 - STM32F446RE development board
 - Bio-potential + IMU sensor


### Software and tool Requirements:
 - STM32CubeIDE
 - Segger SystemView 3.58


### 3rd Party Firmware Requirements:
 - Segger SystemView 3.58 Target package
 - FreeRTOS Kernel V10.5.1

### Installation:
 - Ensure you have `gcc`, `make`, and other necessary tools installed.
